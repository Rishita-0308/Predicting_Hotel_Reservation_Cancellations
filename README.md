# 🏨 Predicting Hotel Reservation Cancellations

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify whether a hotel reservation is likely to be canceled. By analyzing booking data, the model helps hotels improve resource allocation, reduce last-minute cancellations, and optimize revenue.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Hotels face frequent cancellations which disrupt planning and revenue. Predicting cancellations ahead of time can enable proactive strategies like overbooking or targeted customer engagement to minimize financial losses.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables
   - Feature selection and engineering (e.g., lead time, total guests)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identified key factors influencing cancellations like `lead_time`, `market_segment`, `deposit_type`, and `booking_changes`

3. **Model Building**
   - Trained and tested multiple models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

4. **Insights**
   - Long lead times and non-refundable bookings had higher cancellation rates
   - Random Forest gave the best performance (insert metric if available)

## ✅ Results
- Achieved strong predictive performance for cancellation detection
- Delivered insights that can help hotels in overbooking decisions and customer targeting
